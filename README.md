# MOA Utils

This repository provides utilities for calculating the Agnle in MOA or MRAD for a given drop (in m) and distance (in `m`), as well as calculating the drop (in `m`) for a given Angle and distance (in `m`).
And also a command line to test your abilities to calculate Angles and Drop with a quizz.
